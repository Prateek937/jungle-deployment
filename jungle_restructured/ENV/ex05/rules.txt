Naming Rules:

Resource names must be build on the following construct:
 - <solution_name>-<stage>-<instance_name>/<sequence_number>-<resource-type> 
        (ex.   ex05-dev-master-eks, ex05-1)

 - No resource type in name (x)
 - No region name in name
 - stage of the solution

 When we talk about subnet:
 - <solution_name>-<stage>-<type>-<sequence_number>

Tagging Rules:

1. the resources which is strongly connected 
Name : instance
Solution : ex05
Stage : Dev


    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${var.eks_cluster_name}" = "shared",
